# here are some series of data science tasks that i am performing 
## task 1 
In this task i have coded linear reggression from scratch in python using 
1) the normal equation 
2) Gradient descent

The reggression performed is a one variable but the same could be applied for multivariable just By increasing columns of X vector of feature
## task 2

In this task, I have taken the iris dataset and performed k-means clustering algorithm on it
the important thing is you need to have insight about what you are doing so, I have implemented elbow method to find out the best no. of clusters
